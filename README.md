# Tran Long Tuan

My name is Tuan, i'm 24 Years Old. this is the place where i introduce myself i dont really know what to talk anymore.

My last job is Electrical Engineer, i used to design chips and mainboard.

my hobbies are:

1. Games
2. Movies
3. lay around
4. sleep

In the past, i self-learn coding to do my thesis so i can say i have known coding for **5** years. I knows **HTML, CSS, JS** and **Typescript**

The reason that i intersted in this course is, like i said, i want to change my career so that im not bore to death. and have some fun while doing my job and also get some money along the way.

_NONE_. My moto is

> Just do your best and everything will be ok.

So i dont really have anything to fear. Yolo.
